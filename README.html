<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a>, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970</p>

<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

<ol>
<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ol>
